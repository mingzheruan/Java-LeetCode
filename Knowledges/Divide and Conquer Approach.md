## Introduction





## Applied situations

Some features:

1. The problem can be narrowed to the extent, which is easy to solve.
2. The problem can be divided into some same and small questions, it means optimal substructure.
3. These subproblems of problem can merge as the solution of this problem.
4. The'se subproblems are independent,  which means that subproblems don't contain the public sub-subproblem



Applied Algorithms:

1. Binary Search
2. Quicksort
3. Merge Sort
4. Closest Pair of Points
5. Strassen's Algorithm
6. Cooley - Turkey Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) Algorithm
7. Karatsuba Algorithem for Fast Multiplication



## Basic Steps of Divide and Conquer Approach

1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.

2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems.

3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers.
